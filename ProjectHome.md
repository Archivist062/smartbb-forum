# SmartBB #

Right now, it isn't much in the way of a forum, but is the basis of what is the hope for a future piece of forum software. It aims to be simple in directory structure, no databases whatsoever unlike other forum software. Everything was coded from scratch, and it is not based on any other forum.

The name is a combination of my username (smartboyathome), and the initials for bulletin board. I (smartboyathome) created the project to further my knowlege in PHP, and because none of the flat file forums really suited my needs.

I am starting it out as open source because I want to share the project with people, perhaps some will help code or offer ideas which further my knowledge in PHP. Plus, I don't like to keep most things bottled up and kept to myself.

So enjoy it, please report any problems on the bug tracker, and look over the code if you know PHP. I am always open to new ideas on how to do things.
